Lab 2 on exporting SystemVerilog routines
For Mastering Questa learning path, DPI chapter

The SV code in test.v calls the context task c_testbench in c_tb.c,
which calls the SystemVerilog tasks sv_mem_allocate(), sv_mem_read(), and
sv_mem_write()

Compile & run with:
	% vsim -do "do run.do; run -all; quit"

This works with Questa 10.6c on Linux and Windows, and probably eariler
versions too. However, C debug is only available on Linux.
