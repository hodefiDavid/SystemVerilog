Full Adder Module Specification (full_adder_1bit)
Module Description:

The full_adder_1bit module implements a single-bit full adder circuit. 
It takes three one-bit inputs (i_a, i_b, and i_cin) and produces 
two one-bit outputs (o_sum and o_carry).

Inputs:

i_a: First operand (one bit)
i_b: Second operand (one bit)
i_cin: Carry-in signal (one bit)

Outputs:

o_sum: Sum of the three inputs (one bit)
o_carry: Carry-out signal (one bit)
Functional Specification:

The o_sum output represents the sum of the three inputs (i_a, i_b, and i_cin).
The o_carry output represents the carry-out generated from the addition operation.

Truth Table:
